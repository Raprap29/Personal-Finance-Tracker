Personal Finance Tracker

A Personal Finance Tracker is a digital tool or website that helps individuals manage, track, and optimize their financial situation. The purpose of this tool is to give users a clear overview of their income, expenses, savings, and financial goals. By having a detailed record of daily financial transactions, it empowers users to make informed decisions, stay on budget, and work toward their financial objectives.



Income Tracking:

Allows users to input their income sources, such as salaries, freelance work, passive income, etc.
Expense Tracking:

Users can log daily, weekly, or monthly expenses, categorized by type (e.g., groceries, entertainment, rent, etc.).
Budgeting:

The tracker helps set budget limits for different categories (e.g., “$300/month for dining out”) and notifies the user when they exceed those limits.
Savings Goals:

Users can set savings targets (e.g., saving for an emergency fund, a vacation, or a new gadget) and track their progress over time.
Financial Insights/Reports:

The app generates reports and visualizations (charts, graphs) to show spending patterns, income versus expenses, and savings trends.
